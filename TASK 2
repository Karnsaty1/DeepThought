Additional Considerations
Pagination: For large numbers of nudges, consider implementing pagination to avoid overwhelming clients.
Webhooks: Provide a webhook endpoint for clients to receive notifications when nudges are created, updated, or deleted.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
Testing: Thoroughly test your API to ensure it functions correctly and handles various scenarios.
